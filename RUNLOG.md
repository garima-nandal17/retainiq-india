# RetainIQ India — Build Runlog

An engineering diary for the RetainIQ India project. One entry per working day, appended while the work is fresh. This file is the *narrative* of how the project evolved; the BRD, code, and docs are the *artifacts* it produced. It grows from Day 1 through Day 15.

**Conventions**
- Newest entry at the top.
- Each entry: what I set out to do, what I decided, what I built, what's still open.
- Design decisions are logged inline with a short rationale (lightweight ADR style).

## Day 1 — Problem Framing, BRD & Repo Scaffold

**Goal for today:** Establish the business problem and decision frame *before* touching data, and scaffold a clean repository. Deliberately no modeling, no data download.

### Done
- **Project objective finalized.** Positioned as a *Customer Decision Intelligence Platform*, not a churn-prediction project. The product is a budget-constrained contact decision, not a probability.
- **Business problem finalized.** BharatConnect spends a fixed monthly retention budget by intuition; the question is reframed from *"who churns?"* to *"given a fixed budget, whom do we contact, with which offer, to maximize net revenue retained?"*
- **North Star metric fixed:** Net Revenue Retained `(simulation-based estimate)` — explicitly *not* model accuracy.
- **BRD authored** (`docs/BRD.md` v1.1): problem, stakeholders (primary: Priya Menon, Head of Retention), success metric, scope, constraints, assumptions, risks, decision-frame chain, glossary.
- **Repository scaffolded.** Folder tree created with `.gitkeep` placeholders: `src/`, `sql/`, `data/{raw,processed}/`, `tests/`, `notebooks/`, `app/components/`, `docs/portfolio/`, `.github/workflows/`, `models/`.
- **`.gitignore`** in place — raw and processed data are never committed; models excluded; secrets excluded.
- **`requirements.txt`** prepared with the intended stack (see decision D-002).

### Design decisions (rationale logged)
- **D-001 — Project naming.** GitHub repo `retainiq-india`; local folder `RetainIQ_India`. Tagline: *Customer Decision Intelligence Platform for Budget-Constrained Retention Optimization*. Reason: consistent naming across docs/commands prevents drift; the tagline forces the "platform, not predictor" framing everywhere.
- **D-002 — Python 3.13 locked.** Verified every planned dependency (pandas, numpy, duckdb, scikit-learn, lifelines, shap, scipy, statsmodels, streamlit, matplotlib, seaborn, jupyter, pytest) supports Python 3.13 on current releases. Chose 3.13 to match the existing dev machine and the prior MacroPulse project — no reason to maintain a second interpreter. `requirements.txt` now uses 3.13-safe version *floors*; exact versions to be frozen into `requirements.lock` after first clean install (see OPEN-1).
- **D-003 — Documentation evolves, not backfilled.** The polished production README is reserved as the Day-15 target and staged at `docs/planning/README_final_target.md` (git-ignored). The live `README.md` is a minimal Day-1 stub. Reason: a repo whose first commit is the final README reads as a portfolio prop, not a real build.
- **D-004 — `data_acquisition.md` deferred to data-download day (Day 2).** It documents a source, a relabeling, and assumptions for data not yet downloaded — documentation ahead of reality, the exact anti-pattern we're avoiding. The *intent* (use the IBM Telco Customer Churn dataset, relabel to BharatConnect, rupee-denominate charges) is captured here in the runlog and as an assumption in the BRD. The full provenance doc — with actual download date, row count, and file hash — will be written when the file is really on disk. Draft staged at `docs/planning/data_acquisition_draft.md`.

### Open / carried to next day
- **OPEN-1:** Create the Python 3.13 venv, `pip install -r requirements.txt`, then `pip freeze > requirements.lock`; commit both. (Owner: me, before Day 2 coding.)
- **OPEN-2:** Create the GitHub repo `retainiq-india` and push the Day-1 commits below.
- **OPEN-3 (Day 2):** Download IBM Telco dataset into `data/raw/`, record its provenance, and *then* author the real `docs/data_acquisition.md` + `docs/data_dictionary.md`.

### Commits for today
```
init: repo scaffold + .gitignore
docs: BRD with net-revenue-retained success metric
docs: add build runlog (day 1)
```
